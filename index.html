        Overview
    </h1>
    <p>
        The rapid proliferation of urbanization has modernized people’s lives and at the same time engendered critical challenges, such as traffic congestion, energy consumption, public security, and environmental pollution. Today, multiple multimedia sensing technologies and large-scale computing infrastructures are producing at a rapid velocity a wide variety of big multi-modality data in urban spaces, which provide rich knowledge about a city to help tackle these challenges. Consequently, intelligent urban computing has been attracting increasing attention from academia and industry. Among them, human analysis and vehicle analysis constitute the most important foundation for intelligent urban computing. There applications are becoming pervasive in the field of urban planning, transportation systems, environmental conservation, energy consumption, economy, and public security.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of this workshop is to: 1) bring together the state of the art research on human and vehicle analysis for intelligent urban computing; 2) call for a coordinated effort to understand the opportunities and challenges emerging in human and vehicle analysis; 3) identify key tasks and evaluate the state-of-the-art methods; 4) showcase innovative methodologies and ideas; 5) introduce interesting real-world intelligent urban computing systems or applications; and 6) propose new real-world datasets and discuss future directions. We solicit original contributions in all fields of human and vehicle analysis that explore the big data in big cities to help us understand the nature of urban phenomena and even predict the future of cities. We believe the workshop will offer a timely collection of research updates to benefit the researchers and practitioners working in the broad computer vision, multimedia, and pattern recognition communities. To this end, we solicit original research and survey papers in (but not limited to) the following topics:
