    <title>The First International Workshop on Human and Vehicle Analysis for Intelligent Urban Computing</title>
</head>
<body>
Milan, Italy, 13 Sep. 2020
Overview
The rapid proliferation of urbanization has modernized peopleâ€™s lives and at the same time engendered critical challenges, such as traffic congestion, energy consumption, public security, and environmental pollution. Today, multiple multimedia sensing technologies and large-scale computing infrastructures are producing at a rapid velocity a wide variety of big multi-modality data in urban spaces, which provide rich knowledge about a city to help tackle these challenges. Consequently, intelligent urban computing has been attracting increasing attention from academia and industry. Among them, human analysis and vehicle analysis constitute the most important foundation for intelligent urban computing. There applications are becoming pervasive in the field of urban planning, transportation systems, environmental conservation, energy consumption, economy, and public security.
